## ADR-009: Automated Documentation Generation (ADG) Framework
**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: Oct 01, 2025
**Context**: Documentation in fast-paced development environments often becomes stale, incomplete, or inconsistent with the actual codebase. Manual documentation efforts are time-consuming and error-prone, leading to developer frustration and reduced team productivity. There is a critical need for a system that can automatically generate and maintain comprehensive, accurate, and production-ready documentation.
**Decision**: Implement an Automated Documentation Generation (ADG) Framework comprising a Documentation Orchestrator Service and a Project Context Analyzer Service, both deeply integrated with the Semantic Core, Knowledge Graph, CALM architectural definitions, and the Cognitive Artifact Engine.
**Rationale**: By leveraging the SEA's existing semantic infrastructure, architectural governance layer, and AI-driven artifact generation capabilities, the ADG Framework can produce documentation that is not only accurate and comprehensive but also semantically aligned with enterprise vocabulary and architecturally validated. The Documentation Orchestrator coordinates the generation process, while the Project Context Analyzer extracts rich contextual information from multiple sources (code, DSL definitions, SBVR rules, CALM models, Knowledge Graph). This ensures that generated documentation reflects the true state of the system, adheres to organizational standards, and provides value to developers, architects, and other stakeholders. The framework treats documentation as a first-class cognitive artifact, generated using CADSL and rendered through the existing artifact rendering infrastructure.
**Alternatives Considered**: 
  - Static documentation generators (e.g., Sphinx, JSDoc): Rejected due to limited semantic awareness, lack of integration with architectural governance, and inability to generate context-aware cognitive artifacts.
  - Manual documentation processes: Rejected due to high maintenance burden, inconsistency risk, and poor scalability.
  - General-purpose AI documentation tools: Rejected as they lack the semantic grounding, architectural validation, and enterprise-specific context that SEA provides.
**Consequences**:
  - Positive: Always up-to-date documentation, reduced manual effort, improved developer onboarding, enhanced knowledge sharing, semantic consistency between code and documentation, architectural compliance validation in documentation, documentation as interactive cognitive artifacts.
  - Negative: Requires development and maintenance of two new services, dependency on quality of semantic definitions and architectural models, initial configuration effort for project-specific documentation templates.
