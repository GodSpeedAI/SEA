# Sentient Enterprise Architecture (SEA) 5.0: Cognitive Amplification with Automated Documentation üß†‚ú®

## Project Identity & Value Proposition

**Sentient Enterprise Architecture (SEA) 5.0** is a groundbreaking, AI-native architectural framework designed to transform enterprises into intelligent, adaptive, and self-documenting entities. It goes beyond traditional automation, enabling **cognitive amplification** for human knowledge workers and ensuring **continuous architectural integrity** through automated governance.

### ‚ùì Problem Statement

In today's complex, fast-evolving enterprise landscape, organizations face critical challenges:

*   **Semantic Drift**: Inconsistent understanding and application of business terms and rules across systems and teams, leading to miscommunication and errors.
*   **Architectural Non-Compliance**: Difficulty in enforcing architectural standards and preventing technical debt, resulting in brittle and unmaintainable systems.
*   **Cognitive Overload**: Information deluge, fragmented knowledge, and manual processes lead to reduced focus, decision fatigue, and decreased productivity for knowledge workers.
*   **Stale Documentation**: Manual documentation efforts are time-consuming, often outdated, and fail to keep pace with rapid development cycles, hindering developer onboarding and collaboration.
*   **Inconsistent AI Behavior**: AI agents lack domain-specific grounding and predictable responses, leading to 

unreliable outcomes and lack of trust.

### üí° Solution Overview

SEA 5.0 addresses these challenges by integrating a **Semantic Core**, **Architectural Governance (CALM)**, a **Cognitive Extension Layer**, and an **Automated Documentation Generation (ADG) Framework**. It provides:

*   **Unified Business Semantics**: A machine-readable, human-understandable foundation for all enterprise knowledge and rules, powered by SBVR and DSLs.
*   **Dynamic Architectural Governance**: Continuous validation and enforcement of architectural standards using FINOS CALM, ensuring integrity and compliance.
*   **Cognitive Amplification**: AI-driven generation and recommendation of interactive **Cognitive Artifacts** (defined via CADSL) that enhance human intelligence, manage attention, and guide intention.
*   **Automated Documentation**: Dynamic analysis of project context to generate high-quality, production-ready `README.md` files and other documentation, ensuring knowledge is always current and accessible.
*   **Adaptive AI Agents**: Configurable AI behaviors grounded in enterprise knowledge, managed through a **Prompt Management DSL**, leading to trustworthy and context-aware AI assistance.

### ‚ú® Key Benefits

*   **Accelerated Innovation**: Rapid development cycles with AI-assisted code generation and declarative UI definition.
*   **Enhanced Decision-Making**: Real-time, context-aware insights and cognitive support for knowledge workers.
*   **Reduced Technical Debt**: Automated architectural compliance and semantic consistency prevent architectural drift.
*   **Improved Developer Experience**: Always up-to-date, high-quality documentation for seamless onboarding and collaboration.
*   **Increased Trust in AI**: AI agents grounded in enterprise semantics provide reliable and relevant assistance.
*   **Operational Efficiency**: Streamlined processes, reduced cognitive load, and consistent application of business rules.

### üéØ Target Audience

*   **Enterprise Architects**: Seeking to implement adaptive, AI-native architectural frameworks.
*   **Software Developers**: Building complex enterprise applications and needing robust documentation and cognitive support.
*   **Product Managers**: Aiming to deliver intelligent, user-centric solutions that leverage AI effectively.
*   **Business Analysts**: Requiring clear, unambiguous definitions of business rules and processes.
*   **AI/ML Engineers**: Designing and deploying context-aware, semantically grounded AI agents.

    git clone https://github.com/your-org/sea-5.0.git
    cd sea-5.0
    ```

2.  **Set up Environment Variables**:
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory based on `.env.example` and populate it with your database credentials, API keys for LLM providers, and other configurations.

3.  **Start Infrastructure Services (Neo4j, PostgreSQL, Message Queue)**:
    ```bash
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.infra.yml up -d
    ```

4.  **Build and Start Microservices**:
    ```bash
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.services.yml up --build -d
    ```

5.  **Start Web Application**:
    ```bash
    cd web-app
    npm install # or yarn install
    npm start # or yarn start
    ```

### üèÉ Basic Usage: Generate an Enhanced README

Once all services are running, you can interact with the Documentation Orchestrator to generate a README for a sample project.

1.  **Access the Web Application**: Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`.
2.  **Navigate to Documentation Section**: Find the section for automated documentation generation.
3.  **Select a Sample Project**: Choose a pre-configured sample project (e.g., `sample-microservice-a`).
4.  **Click "Generate README"**: The system will analyze the project and display the generated `README.md` in an interactive viewer.

### ‚úÖ Verification

*   Check Docker logs (`docker-compose logs -f`) to ensure all services started without errors.
