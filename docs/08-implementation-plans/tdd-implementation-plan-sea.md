# Test-Driven Development (TDD) Implementation Plan for Sentient Enterprise Architecture (SEA) 5.0

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the Test-Driven Development (TDD) implementation plan for the Sentient Enterprise Architecture (SEA) 5.0. TDD will be a foundational practice throughout the development lifecycle, ensuring high-quality, robust, and maintainable software that aligns with the architectural decisions (ADRs), product requirements (PRDs), and software design specifications (SDSs) outlined in the SEA 5.0 documentation. The goal is to build a system where every component is thoroughly tested, and changes can be introduced with confidence, fostering agility and reducing technical debt. This includes comprehensive testing for the newly integrated Automated Documentation Generation (ADG) Framework.

## 2. TDD Principles and Workflow

The TDD workflow will adhere to the classic 

Red-Green-Refactor cycle:

1.  **Red**: Write a failing test case for a small piece of new functionality. This test should clearly define the desired behavior based on the PRDs and SDSs.
2.  **Green**: Write the minimum amount of code necessary to make the failing test pass. Focus solely on passing the test, even if the code is not yet optimal.
3.  **Refactor**: Improve the code's design, readability, and maintainability while ensuring all tests continue to pass. This step is crucial for keeping the codebase clean and adaptable.

This cycle will be applied iteratively, building functionality incrementally and ensuring continuous validation against requirements.

## 3. Testing Strategy by Component

    - Node.js: `Jest`, `React Testing Library`
- **Integration Testing**: 
    - Docker Compose for spinning up dependent services (databases, message brokers).
    - Contract testing (e.g., Pact) for inter-service API interactions.
- **End-to-End Testing**: 
    - UI Automation: `Playwright` or `Cypress` for testing the Web Application and CADSL Renderer.
    - API Testing: `Postman` or `curl` scripts integrated into CI/CD.
- **Code Coverage**: `Coverage.py` (Python), `JaCoCo` (Java), `Istanbul` (Node.js) to ensure adequate test coverage (target > 80%).
- **CI/CD Integration**: All tests will be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitLab CI, GitHub Actions) to run automatically on every code commit. Failing tests will block merges to main branches.

## 5. Definition of Done (DoD) for TDD

For any feature or bug fix, the Definition of Done will include:
- All new code is covered by unit tests.
- All unit tests pass.
- Relevant integration tests pass.
- Code coverage targets are met.
- Code adheres to style guides and passes linting checks.
- Functionality meets the specified PRDs and SDSs.
- Architectural decisions (ADRs) are respected.
- Documentation (including `ard.md`, `prd.md`, `sds.md`, `technical-specifications.md`, `traceability-matrix.md`) is updated as necessary.

## 6. Training and Best Practices

- **Developer Training**: All developers will receive training on TDD principles, chosen testing frameworks, and best practices for writing effective tests.
- **Pair Programming**: Encourage pair programming to foster knowledge sharing and improve test quality.
- **Test Review**: Tests will be reviewed as part of the code review process to ensure they are clear, concise, and cover the intended functionality.
- **Continuous Refactoring**: Emphasize the importance of the refactoring step in the TDD cycle to maintain a clean and adaptable codebase.

This TDD implementation plan provides a robust framework for developing the SEA 4.0 with confidence, ensuring that quality is built in from the ground up and that the system remains adaptable to future changes and enhancements.
