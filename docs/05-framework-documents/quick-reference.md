# **Quick Reference Guide - Version 5.0: Cognitive Amplification with Automated Documentation**

This guide provides a concise overview of the core concepts, axioms, and practical applications of the Sentient Enterprise Architecture (SEA) Version 5.0, with a focus on the Cognitive Extension Layer and the newly integrated Automated Documentation Generation (ADG) Framework. It serves as a rapid reference for developers and architects working within the SEA framework.

## **1. Core Axioms of SEA 5.0**

*   **Isomorphic Architecture:** Meaning, once formally defined in the Semantic Core (DSL), must be conserved and consistently projected across all layers (Computational, Knowledge, Intelligence, Architectural, Cognitive Extension, Documentation, Identity).
*   **Semantic Primacy:** The DSL, rigorously enforced by SBVR, is the single source of truth for business semantics, driving all generative processes including documentation.
*   **Architecture-as-Code:** CALM formally defines and governs the system architecture, enabling versioning, automated validation, and continuous compliance, which informs documentation generation.
*   **Cognitive Amplification:** AI acts as a proactive cognitive partner, dynamically generating and recommending cognitive artifacts to enhance human intelligence, focus, and intention.
*   **Documentation as Knowledge Artifact:** Documentation is treated as a first-class cognitive artifact, automatically generated and maintained to ensure knowledge currency and accessibility.
*   **Feedback-Driven Evolution:** Continuous learning from process mining, user interaction with cognitive artifacts, and documentation usage refines the DSL and AI models, fostering adaptive intelligence.

## **2. The Isomorphic Stack (8 Layers)**

| Layer | Description | Key Technologies/Concepts |
| :---- | :---------- | :------------------------ |
| **1. Semantic Core** | Formal, generative definition of the enterprise. | DSL (MUDM), SBVR (Business Vocabulary & Rules) |
| **2. Architectural Layer** | Formal definition and governance of system architecture. | CALM (Nodes, Relationships, Controls) |
| **3. Computational Layer** | Executable projection of the DSL. | DDD, Hexagonal Architecture, AI-Driven Code Generation |
| **4. Knowledge Layer** | Inferential projection of the DSL. | Knowledge Graph (RDF, OWL, SHACL) |
| **5. Intelligence Layer** | AI agents operating on and interacting with other layers. | AI Agents, Prompt Management DSL (LoRA/Adapters) |
| **6. Cognitive Extension Layer** | Dynamic generation and recommendation of cognitive artifacts. | Cognitive Artifact DSL (CADSL), Artifact Engine, Context Analyzer |
| **7. Documentation Layer (ADG)** | Automated generation of context-aware project documentation. | Documentation Orchestrator, Project Context Analyzer |
| **8. Identity Layer** | External narrative and brand identity. | Brand Semantics, Sphinx, Dual-Modes |

## **3. Cognitive Extension Layer: Key Concepts**

*   **Cognitive Artifacts:** Symbolic tools (e.g., notes, checklists, diagrams) that capture and organize knowledge, focus attention, and express intentions. They are dynamically generated by AI.
*   **Cognitive Artifact DSL (CADSL):** A declarative language built from a MECE set of symbolic elements (Text, Visual, Structural, Interactive, Relational, Organizational, Annotation, Temporal, Feedback, Semantic, Collaboration Elements) for defining cognitive artifacts.
*   **Artifact Engine:** The core component responsible for generating and recommending cognitive artifacts based on conversational context, user needs, and project goals.
*   **Context Analyzer:** Processes dialogue, user intent, and project goals to provide relevant context for artifact recommendations.
*   **Recommendation Algorithm:** Identifies optimal cognitive artifacts based on context, user feedback, and cognitive ergonomics principles.
*   **User Feedback Processor:** Learns from user acceptance/rejection of recommendations to continuously refine the recommendation algorithm.

## **4. AI Chatbot Artifact Recommendation Flow (High-Level)**

1.  **User Interaction:** Knowledge worker interacts with the AI chatbot.
2.  **Context Analysis:** AI Agent (Conversation) sends dialogue, intent, and project goals to the Context Analyzer.
3.  **Contextual Grounding:** Context Analyzer queries Knowledge Graph and Domain Services for semantic and operational data.
4.  **Recommendation:** AI Agent requests artifact recommendation from the Recommendation Algorithm, which evaluates triggers, patterns, and scores potential artifacts.
5.  **Artifact Generation:** AI Agent requests artifact generation from the Artifact Engine, which uses the CADSL Runtime to construct the artifact.
6.  **Presentation:** AI Agent presents the interactive cognitive artifact to the user via the UI.
7.  **Feedback Loop:** User interaction with the artifact (edit, accept, reject) provides feedback to the Recommendation Algorithm for continuous learning.

## **5. Automated Documentation Generation (ADG) Framework: Key Concepts**

*   **Documentation Orchestrator Service:** Coordinates the automated generation of comprehensive project documentation, leveraging semantic context, architectural definitions, and the Artifact Engine.
*   **Project Context Analyzer Service:** Extracts rich contextual information from project codebases, DSL definitions, SBVR rules, CALM architectural models, and the Knowledge Graph.
*   **Context-Aware Documentation:** Documentation is generated with full awareness of the project's semantic grounding, architectural compliance, technical stack, and business domain.
*   **Documentation as Cognitive Artifact:** Documentation is treated as a first-class cognitive artifact, generated using CADSL and rendered through the existing artifact rendering infrastructure.
*   **Continuous Documentation:** Documentation can be automatically updated as the project evolves, ensuring it always reflects the current state.

## **6. ADG Workflow (High-Level)**

1.  **Documentation Request:** User or automated trigger requests documentation generation for a project.
2.  **Context Extraction:** Project Context Analyzer analyzes the project codebase, extracting semantic concepts from DSL/SBVR, architectural patterns from CALM, technical stack details, and dependencies.
3.  **Context Enrichment:** Analyzer queries Knowledge Graph for additional business context and relationships.
4.  **Documentation Generation:** Documentation Orchestrator uses extracted context to request artifact generation from the Artifact Engine, specifying documentation type (README, API docs, etc.).
5.  **CADSL Construction:** Artifact Engine constructs documentation as a CADSL artifact, including appropriate sections, code examples, diagrams, and API references.
6.  **Rendering & Presentation:** CADSL Runtime renders the documentation (Markdown, HTML) and presents it to the user via the UI.
7.  **Validation:** Generated documentation is validated for accuracy, completeness, and architectural compliance.

## **7. CALM Integration for Cognitive Extension & ADG**

CALM plays a crucial role in governing both the Cognitive Extension Layer and the ADG Framework by:

*   **Defining Nodes:** Specifying the `artifact-engine`, `context-analyzer`, `recommendation-algorithm`, `cadsl-runtime`, `documentation-orchestrator`, and `project-context-analyzer` as architectural nodes.
*   **Defining Relationships:** Documenting how these cognitive and documentation components interact with each other and with other SEA layers (e.g., `artifact-engine` informs `user-interface`, `context-analyzer` queries `knowledge-graph-service`, `project-context-analyzer` queries `calm-cli-service`).
*   **Enforcing Controls:** Ensuring that the design and implementation of cognitive services and documentation generation adhere to architectural standards, security policies, and performance requirements.

## **8. Data Schemas (Key Entities)**

*   **Entity, Resource, Flow, Instance, Policy:** Core business domain entities, defined in JSON Schema, forming the basis of the Semantic Core and Knowledge Layer.
*   **CadslElement (Base):** Foundation for all cognitive artifact elements.
*   **Specific CADSL Elements:** Schemas for `TextField`, `Checkbox`, `Section`, etc., defining their properties and structure.
*   **CognitiveArtifact:** Schema for a complete artifact, composed of a canvas of CADSL elements.
*   **AIAgentConfiguration:** Schema for configuring AI agents, including prompt templates, context sources, skills, and behavior adapters.
*   **UserInteractionFeedback:** Schema for capturing user interactions and feedback on cognitive artifacts and recommendations.
*   **DocumentationRequest:** Schema for requesting automated documentation generation.
*   **DocumentationArtifact:** Schema for generated documentation artifacts with content and metadata.
*   **ProjectContext:** Schema for comprehensive contextual information extracted from projects.

This quick reference guide highlights the essential components and interactions of SEA 5.0, emphasizing its capacity to integrate business semantics, architectural governance, advanced AI, and automated documentation to create a truly intelligent, cognitively amplified, and self-documenting enterprise.
